# AutoCompleter

Autocompleter engine made by my friend and I. 

To run: path to a2/autocomplete_engines.py and run the last 3 defined methods. 
        You can change what you are searching for by replacing the arguments in the constructor for engine.autocomplete()...
        
The skeleton of this program was provided directly by UOfT professor David Liu. My friend and I solely worked on the abstract data type
algorithm and the file input algorithm.
